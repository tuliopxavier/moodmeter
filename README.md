<h1> 😊 Moodmeter 🙁 </h1>

Project for The Weekly Web Dev Challenge (Energy Meter), led by Leanne Ryba of Scrimba.com .

The challenge was to add interaction using ```<meter>``` tag and javascript.
I took a step foward and incorporated a message linked to the meter and did some improvemetns on the style, bringing in a bit of animation and transition.

```
What you can pratice on this challenge:
- Javascript
- DOM Manipulation with Javascrpt
- HTML new tag <meter>, label and input
- CSS animation, transition and media queries
```
